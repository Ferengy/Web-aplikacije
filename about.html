            After more than two decades, the legacy of the Dark Wanderer and the demonic burden he bears is making a
            resurgence in the realms of humanity . Diablo II: Resurrected is the definitive remastering of Diablo II
            and its Lord of Destruction®️ expansion—two hallmark entries in Blizzard Entertainment’s genre-defining
            action role-playing series. Veteran players from 20 years ago, as well as those who are new to the
            franchise, can now experience Diablo II’s timeless gameplay with modern visuals and numerous quality of
            life improvements.</p>
        <p>The Rogue Encampment is the starting location in Diablo II, where you undertake your goal of attempting to
            catch up with Diablo before he frees his brothers and Hell is unleashed on Sanctuary as the Prophecy
            foretells.</p>

        <p> The Rogue Encampment is a makeshift town located right next to the Blood Moor. As its name designates, it is
            the camp set up by the survivors of the battle at the Rogue Monastery. The Rogue Monastery was attacked by
            the forces of Hell in an effort by Diablo to create a stronghold on Sanctuary against the forces of Heaven,
            and destroy opposing mortals, as the Sisters of the Sightless Eye had.</p>

        <p>Many rogues died or were corrupted by the evil and started roaming the countryside along with other tainted
            creatures and demons. Such rogues include Bloodraven (the Rogue heroine from Diablo I), Coldcrow and
            Andariel (who took over the body of a Rogue and transformed).</p>
