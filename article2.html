    <h2>A LETTER FROM OUR GAME DIRECTOR – BLIZZCON 2019</h2>



    <p>Dear Diablo family,

        Thank you all for a great BlizzCon. We unveiled Diablo IV with our announce cinematic, establishing the tone for
        our overall creative vision moving forward. We hope you all dug that.</p>

    <p>We also showed you our gameplay trailer, showcasing our classes, monsters, and open world, and invited you to
        take the first step in this journey toward Diablo IV together. We can tell from all the questions and excitement
        we’ve seen online and in-person that you are eager to find out more.</p>

    <p>The lines to our demo stations and Dark Gallery were packed all weekend long and we were floored by the overall
        reception—especially from long-time Diablo players. We were blown away by how often we met people who came back
        to play the demo again and again. The stories you shared with us about Diablo and what this series means to you
        moved us and inspire us to do our best.</p>

    <p>We’ve been taking this week to assess and discuss our takeaways from BlizzCon, and we love all the deep
        discussions happening around the art, features, systems, and world of Diablo IV. We’re also excited about a cool
        update we’re planning for you in February of next year. It will be the first in a series of quarterly updates
        where we’ll share behind-the-scenes looks at our progress going forward.
    </p>

    <p>We also know that one topic is burning hotter than the rest. We want you to know that we are having the same
        conversations about items and stats that you are having—whether on the official discussion threads or external
        sites, we read it all! Getting this right is at the top of our minds, and in the coming weeks our lead systems
        designer David Kim will provide a few clarifications, share some of his thoughts, and address some of your open
        questions. We hope you check it out and let us know what you think</p>
